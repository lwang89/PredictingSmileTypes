# PredictingSmileTypes

## facial_landmarks_dection
We applied openCV(cv2) and dlib to fetch 68 landmarks( the predictor was trained on [iBUG 300-W dataset](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/)).<br>
The whole methodology followed the idea from Adrian Rosebrock([Here is the link:)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/03/facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python/).<br>

I generate the data for traditional ML models and LSTM models during processing frames.<br>
