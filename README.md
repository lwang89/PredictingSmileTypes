# PredictingSmileTypes

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.<br>
### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.  We're using 3.6.2.
You can get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/<br>
2. dlib.<br>
3. openCV(cv2).<br>
4. pandas, numPy and skLearn.<>
5. Pytorch. We're using 0.3.0.
You can get it here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/<br>
## facial_landmarks_dection
We applied openCV(cv2) and dlib to fetch 68 landmarks( the predictor was trained on [iBUG 300-W dataset](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/)).<br>
The whole methodology followed the idea from Adrian Rosebrock([Here is the link:)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/04/03/facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python/).<br>

I generate the data for traditional ML models and LSTM models during processing frames.<br>
